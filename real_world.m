% A MATLAB script to control Rowans Systems & Control Floating Ball 
% Apparatus designed by Mario Leone, Karl Dyer and Michelle Frolio. 
% The current control system is a PID controller.

%% Connect to device

%% Parameters
target      = 0.5;   % Desired height of the ball [m]
sample_rate = 0.25;  % Amount of time between controll actions [s]

%% Give an initial burst to lift ball and keep in air

set_pwm(device, 5000); % Initial burst to pick up ball
pause(0.1) % Wait 0.1 seconds
set_pwm(device, 2000); % Set to lesser value to level out somewhere in
% the pipe

%% Initialize variables
x = 2000; % Same value of last set_pwm   
error       = 0;

%% Feedback loop
while true
